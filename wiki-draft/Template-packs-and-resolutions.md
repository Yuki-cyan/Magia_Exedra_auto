# Template packs and resolutions

Language: [简体中文](./首页) · [English](./Home_EN) · [日本語](./ホーム)

## The aim junction

The `aim/` directory at the repository root is not a real folder but a Windows directory junction that points to one of the real template packs under `language/<lang>/<lang>_<resolution>/`. Switching language or resolution just repoints the `aim` junction; the actual template files are never moved. All runtime paths (`./aim/...`) work as usual because the junction is transparent to reads.

The junction is created with `cmd /c mklink /J` (no admin privileges required) and removed with `os.rmdir` (which removes only the link, not the target contents).

## Pack organization

Source packs are `language/EN/EN_2560x1440` and `language/JP/JP_2560x1440`. Derived 720p/1080p/4K directories are preserved by committed `.gitkeep` files and populated by the Refresh button.

`language/active.json` stores the last selection, but the actual `aim` target remains authoritative.

## Template file naming

Template filenames use the `picture` argument, not `name`. Starting at `<picture>_1.png`, `click_item_with_result(self, picture, name)` and `find_item_with_result(...)` discover consecutively numbered templates until the first missing number. `name` is only a log label.

Numbering must start at `_1` and remain contiguous. For example, under `crystalis/` you have `play_1.png`, `result_1.png` through `result_12.png`, `retry_1.png`, and so on.

All discovered variants in a template group are compared against one shared game frame, and only the globally highest-scoring candidate in the entire group is used. The code does not capture a new frame for each number or favor the first acceptable match. The screenshot and templates receive the same 3x3 `GaussianBlur` before OpenCV `TM_SQDIFF_NORMED` matching.

## Per-image confidence

`resource/template_confidence.txt` defines an independent threshold for every logical PNG. The base format is `relative/template/path = threshold`, for example `crystalis/result_1.png = 0.85`. A logical path applies to every language and derived resolution by default. More specific overrides may use `EN/path`, `JP/path`, or `EN/1920x1080/path`; precedence is language+resolution, language, then the generic path.

Matching is always strict `score > threshold`; equality is not a match. Saving the file hot-reloads it on the next recognition attempt. Missing, duplicate, nonnumeric, or out-of-range 0.0-1.0 entries reject recognition instead of falling back to a global value. Task startup verifies that every PNG in the active pack resolves to a threshold. Add, remove, or rename the TXT entry together with its template.

## Resolution scaling

2K (2560x1440) is the single standard source; other resolutions are derived by scale factor:

| Resolution | Factor | Notes |
|:----------:|:------:|:------|
| 1280x720 | 0.5x | Downsample, good quality |
| 1920x1080 | 0.75x | Downsample, good quality |
| 3840x2160 | 1.5x | Upsample, non-integer, slightly blurry |

Downsampled 720p/1080p packs are higher quality than upsampled 4K packs, but better than an empty pack.

Scaling uses `tools/ImageMagick/magick.exe`, processing each file with ImageMagick `-filter Triangle -resize` while preserving the source pack's subdirectory structure in the target pack. `mogrify -path` is not used because it flattens subdirectories and breaks the `<dirpath>_N.png` grouping.

The current scaling recipe is recipe v2. Generation is skipped only when the source SHA-256, recipe/tool fingerprint, and target SHA-256 all match the manifest. A change to any of them triggers regeneration, preventing damaged or stale targets from being reused. After upgrading the application, use Refresh to rebuild derived packs with the current recipe.

## Pack usability

A pack is usable only when its safe real directory tree contains at least one non-reparse PNG that passes structure, CRC, and Pillow decode checks. Complete PNG validation checks chunk length, CRC, and IHDR/IEND to prevent truncated files from being mistaken for complete packs.

Dropdown selection auto-switches on `QComboBox.activated`; programmatic refresh does not trigger switching. Empty/invalid packs show `（空）`.

## Runtime resolution matching

At startup the client width and height (the actual render area, excluding title bar and borders) are compared independently, each allowing `|detected - expected| <= max(40px, expected*10%)`. This tolerates small offsets from title bars, borders, and DPI scaling without requiring exact equality.

Unknown or mismatched resolution blocks startup. Scaled coordinate actions reject an unknown pack factor rather than guessing 2K.

Recognition captures the visible game window, so the game must remain visible and unobstructed while automation is running.

## Important rules

- Never manually merge/rename `aim/` or edit derived templates as the source of truth. Add new templates such as LV4, and all other variants, only to the 2K source pack, then use Refresh to derive the other resolutions
- Do not delete empty-pack `.gitkeep` placeholders. Missing pack directories are not recreated by the scaler
- `aim/`, `active.json`, derived PNGs, and `.source_hashes.json` are all gitignored (see `.gitignore`)
- Do not add a code-level global confidence value; maintain all template thresholds in `resource/template_confidence.txt`
