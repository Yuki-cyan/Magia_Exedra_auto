## Overview

This tool recognizes game scenes via OpenCV `TM_SQDIFF_NORMED` template matching, performs clicks with PyAutoGUI, and provides a GUI built with PySide6. Two farming modes are supported:

- **Link Raid**: enters backup requests, refreshes, searches one or more selected LV4 and LV6-LV12 teams in the user's priority order, clears finished battles, and joins fights; if a higher-priority level has no eligible room, it tries the next selected level and never joins an unselected level
- **Crystalis**: clicks `play`, waits for results, and repeats stages via `retry`

Both modes support a configurable stamina-potion count and English/Japanese templates at `720p` / `1080p` / `2K` / `4K`. Parameters are saved immediately per mode and restored on the next launch. The application can also send actionable major events through Server酱 to configured channels such as WeChat and Bark.

Automation pauses when the user operates the keyboard or mouse and resumes after five seconds of inactivity. Every template candidate in a group is compared against the same frame, and only the highest-scoring candidate is acted on; while waiting for a template, recovery checks continue every five seconds.
