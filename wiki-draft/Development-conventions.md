# Development conventions

Language: [简体中文](./首页) · [English](./Home_EN) · [日本語](./ホーム)

## Code style

- Code comments and GUI prose are Chinese-first
- `README.md` is authoritative; `README_EN.md` and `README_JP.md` are maintained translations
- Default to ASCII; introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode only when there is a clear reason and the file already lives in that character set
- Add succinct comments only where the code is not self-explanatory; avoid empty narration like "assigns the value to the variable"

## Key return-value conventions

- **Template-action return values are `2`/`1`, not booleans.** `2` means success/found/clicked; `1` means not found/keep trying/cancelled. `find_win()` is the exception: it returns a geometry tuple or `None`
- **Template filenames use the `picture` argument, not `name`.** Starting at `<picture>_1.png`, `click_item_with_result(self, picture, name)` and `find_item_with_result(...)` discover consecutive variants until the first missing number. `name` is only a log label. Numbering must start at `_1` and remain contiguous
- Every variant in a template group must be compared against the same captured frame, and only the globally highest-scoring candidate in the group may be acted on; do not recapture per template or return early in discovery order
- Apply the same 3x3 `GaussianBlur` to the screenshot and templates before `TM_SQDIFF_NORMED`. Every winning PNG must strictly exceed its independently resolved threshold from `resource/template_confidence.txt`; equality is not a match, and a missing or invalid threshold rejects recognition
- All confirmation frames at 0/300/600 ms must compare the complete template group again rather than tracking only the first frame's winner. Threshold resolution must reuse the worker's startup-locked `expected_pack`

## Run/stop state

- Run/stop state is per worker. `_running()` is `_active and not _stop_event.is_set()`
- Use `worker.stop()`; do not reintroduce global `guaji` flags
- `start()` refuses restart while the old thread still runs

## LP recovery values

- LP recovery values are drinks + 1. The GUI displays 0-10 for Link Raid and 0-8 for Crystalis, but passes `shown + 1`
- Internal `1` means zero drinks and stop on first depletion

## Logging

- Use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` for runtime debug output, not `print()`
- The GUI logging handler provides a runtime DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL selector; new installations default to INFO, and the same selection controls the file handler under `logs/`
- When a console exists it defaults to WARNING, and `MAGIA_LOG_LEVEL` can override that level. A `--windowed` build has no console, so missing stderr must be skipped safely without affecting GUI startup
- Worker user-facing messages still go through `signal.emit` and remain visible in the GUI. The main window mirrors them as `magia.runtime` INFO records with a GUI-deduplication marker; new channels must not cause duplicate display
- Retention defaults to seven days and accepts 1-365. Cleanup may remove only strictly named expired Magia logs and must retain the active file-handler family and unrelated files
- `if __name__ == "__main__"` diagnostic blocks may keep `print`; that is CLI direct output, not runtime noise

## GUI parameters

- GUI parameters are registry-driven; there are no module-level parameter globals
- `ParamSpec.kind` supports `choice`, `ordered_multi_choice`, `bool`, `lp_recover`, and `int`; every new kind must also normalize persisted values
- All registered parameters are saved immediately and atomically per stable `WorkerMeta.name`; `lp_recover` stores the visible GUI value and ordered multi-choice stores a non-empty duplicate-free priority list
- `required_templates` paths may contain dynamic placeholders, but each placeholder name must match a declared `ParamSpec.key` for that worker
- To add a new control type, add a `kind` in `registry.py` and a corresponding branch in `main.py`'s `_build_param_widget`

## Adding a new farming mode

1. Write a `BaseWorker` subclass file under `src/workers/`
2. Decorate it with `@register`, declaring the display name, start-screen hint, parameter list, and required templates
3. Add one import line in `src/workers/__init__.py`
4. The `main.py` GUI will automatically show the corresponding button and parameter controls; no GUI code changes needed

The worker must be no-argument-constructible and must route `run()` through `_run_safely()`.

GUI stop actions and application close must call `worker.stop()`, never `_finish()` directly, so manual stops are not misreported as automatic termination. `_emit_major_event()` records that the run already has a major event; `_run_safely()` adds `worker_auto_ended` only for a non-manual end with no other major event.

Server酱 channel settings always allow one or two entries. The GUI blocks a third selection, while `app_settings` must still truncate stale or manually edited over-limit values at the persistence boundary.

## User-input protection and wait recovery

- Keyboard input, real mouse-button activity, or cumulative mouse travel pauses automation; it resumes only after five continuous seconds of user inactivity
- Every new PyAutoGUI input path must call `_wait_for_user_idle()` first, perform automated mouse actions inside an `_automation_input()` context, and record the last automation position after success
- The last automation position is stored relative to the game client. Window movement rebases it; a client-size change or out-of-client coordinate rejects the recovery click
- During a single click-template wait, every continuous five-second miss must trigger a two-second observation of the game client area. If more than 50% of pixels change, treat it as battle animation and skip only that recovery cycle; otherwise perform one recovery click at the last safe automation position
- This five-second recovery cycle must continue until the template succeeds, the wait times out, or the task is cancelled. It must never be implemented as a one-time check

## DPI-sensitive import order

Keep `src.workers` lazy. Startup must remain `QApplication(...) -> mywindow() -> get_worker_registry()`. Importing workers earlier imports PyAutoGUI and may prevent Qt from setting Windows DPI awareness.

## Template pack rules

- `aim/` is a runtime Windows directory junction, not a real template folder
- Never manually merge/rename `aim/` or edit derived templates as the source of truth. Add variants to the 2K source pack and regenerate
- Do not delete empty-pack `.gitkeep` placeholders. Missing pack directories are not recreated by the scaler
- When adding a language, add an entry in `language_switcher.LANG_LABELS`; the GUI reads it automatically

## Game title

The game window title is hardcoded as `MadokaExedra`. Changing it requires updating `main.py`, `click_action.py`, and `click_behavior.py`, or centralizing it first.

## Git and local artifacts

- `.gitignore` ignores `aim/`, `language/active.json`, root `settings.json`, `USER_REQUIREMENTS.txt`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, and `logs/`
- A Server酱 SendKey may exist only in local `settings.json`; never place it in logs, exception text, test fixtures, the requirements ledger, documentation, or release artifacts
- `.gitignore` also ignores derived PNGs, `.source_hashes.json`, `.release-venv-*/`, `build/`, `dist/`, and generated `*.spec` files; committed `.gitkeep` pack placeholders remain tracked
- `tools/ImageMagick/` is committed and required by release packages
- The repository has `main`, `beta`, and potentially other branches. Never infer target branch or release channel from the current branch alone
- Commit messages are plain-language Chinese with a concise subject and body

## Checklist

Standard-library regression tests live under `tests/`; there is currently no lint/typecheck config or CI. After changes, run every applicable non-game check:

- `python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v`
- Python compile/import checks
- Worker registry and template validation
- Update ZIP/extraction checks
- Lock/updater checks
- AMD64 PE validation
- Packaged-app smoke start
