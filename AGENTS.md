# AGENTS.md

Windows-only game-automation bot for **Magia Exedra** (game window title `MadokaExedra`). Image-recognition clicking uses OpenCV `TM_SQDIFF_NORMED` plus PyAutoGUI, with a PySide6 GUI. Code comments and GUI prose are Chinese-first. `README.md` is authoritative; `README_EN.md` and `README_JP.md` are maintained translations.

## Working with the user

- Inspect the repository, `README.md`, and available local context before asking the user. Do not ask questions whose answers can be discovered safely from the project.
- When an uncertainty would materially change scope, behavior, data safety, external side effects, target branch, or release outcome, ask exactly one question at a time and wait for the answer before asking the next dependent question.
- With every clarification question, explain why the answer is needed and which implementation decision, risk, or result it affects. Do not present a bare question without that context.
- When a clarification has two or more concrete solutions, present the solutions as lettered choices (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and so on), one choice per line. Briefly state each choice's behavior or tradeoff, clearly mark the recommended choice and explain the recommendation, and tell the user they may reply with only the letter. Do not hide multiple independent questions inside one option list.
- Use a direct free-form question when predefined choices would be artificial or incomplete; the one-question-at-a-time and rationale requirements still apply.
- If a low-risk, reversible assumption is sufficient, state the assumption and continue instead of blocking. Do not ask ceremonial confirmation questions, except where this file explicitly requires confirmation, such as the push/release workflow.
- Suggestions and concerns may be raised proactively. Keep non-blocking suggestions separate from required clarifications, explain their rationale and tradeoff, and continue the requested work unless the suggestion requires a user decision.
- After the user answers, apply that answer to the active task without repeating already resolved questions. If another material uncertainty remains, ask only that next question.
- Use root `USER_REQUIREMENTS.txt` as a local, untracked continuity ledger so active requirements survive context compaction. At the start of a user-requested change, read it and record the unresolved request before substantive implementation; update it whenever the user makes a choice, changes scope, or resolves a clarification.
- Keep the ledger concise and actionable: record only unfinished requirements, accepted assumptions, user decisions, and blockers needed to resume the task. Do not copy the full conversation, store secrets or credentials, or record completed work as history.
- After each corresponding requirement is implemented and proportionately verified, remove that requirement and its resolved choices from `USER_REQUIREMENTS.txt`. Keep unrelated unfinished entries intact. The file may contain only its explanatory comments when no requirements remain.
- `USER_REQUIREMENTS.txt` must remain ignored by Git and excluded from commits, release staging, archives, and documentation synchronization. If it is missing, recreate it in the project root before recording active work.

## Running / building

- Run: `python main.py`. The entry point changes cwd to the script/exe directory so relative runtime paths resolve. Startup calls `language_switcher.ensure_active()`, which restores or creates the `aim/` junction.
- Build: `pyinstaller -D --windowed -i resource/main.ico -n Magia_Exedra_auto main.py`. `--windowed` prevents an empty console window from opening beside the GUI. The built entry is named `Magia_Exedra_auto.exe` via `-n`; this is the executable shipped in releases. This creates only the PyInstaller onedir output; a distributable package must also place `resource/`, `language/`, and `tools/` beside `Magia_Exedra_auto.exe`.
- In frozen mode, `OPENCV_SKIP_PYTHON_LOADER=1` must be set before anything imports `cv2`.
- **DPI-sensitive import order:** keep `src.workers` lazy. Startup must remain `QApplication(...) -> mywindow() -> get_worker_registry()`. Importing workers earlier imports PyAutoGUI and may prevent Qt from setting Windows DPI awareness. `main.py` calls `log_setup.configure_logging()` at module import, before `QApplication`; this is stdlib-only and safe, and must stay before any business module import so all loggers are captured.
- Runtime dependencies are declared in `requirements.txt` (`pyautogui`, `PySide6`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `pywinctl`, `Pillow`); install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Release builds use `pip install -r requirements-build.txt`, which includes the runtime dependencies and pins the verified PyInstaller 6.21.0 build tool. Runtime versions remain intentionally unpinned until a complete tested environment lock is recorded; do not invent partial pins. Scaling uses committed `tools/ImageMagick/magick.exe` or `magick` on PATH.
- Standard-library regression tests live under `tests/`; run `python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v`. There is no lint/typecheck config or CI. Also run every applicable non-game check: Python compile/import checks, worker registry and template validation, update ZIP/extraction checks, lock/updater checks, AMD64 PE validation, and packaged-app smoke start.

## Architecture

Mode-specific automation lives in `src/workers/`. `main.py` is the GUI entry and application-level task controller: it constructs workers, injects parameters, coordinates automation/scaling/update mutual exclusion, performs startup checks, orchestrates updates, and handles cooperative shutdown. It does not contain Link Raid or Crystalis flow logic.

- `main.py` - `mywindow(QWidget)` plus `LanguageSwitcherWidget` and a modal `SettingsDialog`. It lazily builds one worker and parameter page per `WorkerMeta`; no worker class is hardcoded in the GUI. `_start_worker()` rejects concurrent tasks, unresolved update-recovery markers, missing game windows, unknown client resolution, unavailable matching packs, incomplete required template groups, and invalid parameters. It automatically switches `aim/` to the closest usable resolution for the selected language, then independently rechecks the match. It reads parameters before expanding dynamic required-template paths. The main window exposes one `设置` entry; log settings, beta channel, update actions, and Server酱 notification configuration live in the dialog. The selected worker mode and every registered Worker parameter persist immediately and atomically in root `settings.json`; LP persistence stores the displayed count, not internal `shown + 1`. The masked SendKey, one or two selected official channels, and event toggles also persist there; stale configurations with more than two channels retain only their first two entries. The log selector controls both GUI debug records and the rotating file handler, while worker user messages remain unfiltered. Prerelease builds initialize the beta-update checkbox as selected before the automatic update check starts. Startup completes the automatic update check before scheduling derived-template scaling: no update, check failure, source mode, or declining the prompt continues to scaling, while accepting an update keeps scaling deferred unless preparation fails or is cancelled. Frozen console-mode compatibility hides an existing console, while new builds use `--windowed`. `closeEvent()` uses one shared 12-second deadline to stop/wait for workers, scaling, update checks, and update preparation. Update signals include a task ID so stale thread results are ignored. Source-mode automatic checks log the Release URL; only manual checks open it.
- `src/workers/registry.py` - `ParamSpec` describes GUI parameters. Supported kinds are `choice`, `ordered_multi_choice`, `bool`, `lp_recover`, and `int`; `normalize()` safely folds stale settings back into the current declaration. `WorkerMeta` contains `name`, `label`, `worker_class`, `params`, `start_hint`, and `required_templates`. Required template paths are relative to the pack root, omit `_<number>.png`, and may contain placeholders referencing declared `ParamSpec.key` values. They cover startup-critical groups; optional best-effort groups need not block startup. Adding a mode requires a no-argument-constructible `BaseWorker` subclass decorated with `@register`, plus an import in `src/workers/__init__.py`.
- `src/workers/base.py` - `BaseWorker(QThread)`, `retry_until()`, `RETRY_TIMEOUT=60`, and `BATTLE_TIMEOUT=1800`. Per-worker state is `_active` plus `_stop_event`; `start()` refuses restart while the old thread still runs and resets manual-stop/major-event tracking. `stop()` explicitly marks a manual stop. Each run starts a `UserActivityGuard`, tracks the last automation position, and pauses template actions while the user is active. `_click_until()` polls normal steps every 0.2 seconds and battle waits every 0.5 seconds. During a click-template wait, every 5-second miss observes the game client for 2 seconds: more than 50% changed pixels skips only that recovery cycle as likely battle animation. Before any last-position recovery click it rechecks all declared next-step groups from one shared frame. Normal template-position actions may use the last safe automation position and redundantly click a still-visible current template. Fixed safe-coordinate actions are different: they must freshly recognize the current page, click only up to `fixed_click_limit`, never use last-position recovery, and cannot accept a next-step match until at least one confirmed current-page click has occurred. The 5-second cycle continues until success, timeout, or cancellation. `_run_safely()` holds the cross-process template mutex for the full worker run, rechecks `expected_pack`, handles cancellation/lock timeout/errors, and always calls `_finish()` in `finally`. A non-manual end emits `worker_auto_ended` only when no other major event was emitted during that run; manual stop/application close never emits it. Concrete workers must route `run()` through `_run_safely()`.
- `src/workers/link_raid.py` - Link Raid flow: navigation, backup requests, refresh, joined-battle cleanup, ordered multi-level selection, join/LP handling, battle completion, and return. Level selection searches only the normalized request-list region, evaluates enabled levels in user priority order, and compares every supported level near each candidate using both the full template and an independently scored central level-number region. Both classifiers must select the same enabled level. If a higher-priority level has no eligible room, the next enabled level is tried immediately. Participant detection returns 9, 10, at-most-8, or unreadable; unreadable is allowed, while 9/10 and 10/10 are independently skipped according to their default-on options. When neither a selected target nor `no_lv` is found, it rescans once before at most one downward scroll and one final scan. Every rescue-list refresh enforces a minimum 4.5-second interval from the actual refresh click to the next automation input; recognition and processing time count. All supported level groups are startup-required competitors. Full or already-ended room popups are dismissed before rematching. After `play`, one battle-state loop checks delayed `already_end` and normal result states every 0.5 seconds for the full battle timeout. `tap_to_countinue` uses foreground variants 1/2 only, confirms the page across three frames, and clicks the scaled bottom-center safe position at most twice. The loop does not accept `back` before the first confirmed Tap click. Initial navigation and scrolling use scaled 2K-baseline coordinates.
- `src/workers/crystalis.py` - Crystalis flow. It first performs a scaled 2K-baseline wake-up click at `(2000,1000)`, then loops `click_play -> wait_win -> click_retry_or_recover_lp`. `result` matching is restricted to the right half of the game client; its committed per-image thresholds are currently set to 0.85, preventing stable matches against unrelated left-side graphics.
- `src/click/click_action.py` - collects contiguous numbered templates. Normal group actions compare the complete group against one shared frame and use only the highest-scoring candidate. Each normal template-position click samples at 0/300/600 ms; every winner must exceed its own threshold and remain near the first center, and the click uses the median center. Fixed-position page actions instead confirm presence three times, optionally restrict detection to foreground variants, then click a configured scaled 2K-baseline coordinate. Batched next-step checks share one frame across groups. Competitive level matching may inspect multiple selected-level positions in priority order and apply the configured 9/10 and 10/10 skip set; unreadable counts remain eligible. Threshold resolution reuses the worker's locked `expected_pack`. Raw/scaled click, move, and drag actions use client coordinates and detect the active pack scale tolerantly.
- `src/click/click_behavior.py` - window lookup/focus, client-only screenshot and optional normalized search-region cropping, shared-frame OpenCV matching, client-only motion sampling, participant-count analysis, and mouse action. Window borders and the title bar are never included in template matching. Normal matching applies the same 3x3 Gaussian blur to screenshot and templates before `TM_SQDIFF_NORMED`. Foreground-text matching instead uses locally adaptive screenshot binarization, an Otsu template mask, the same 7x7 outline blur on both sides, and a weighted three-pixel negative-space support region to tolerate resolution rasterization without matching plain bright areas. Template images, normal preprocessing, and foreground masks are cached by resolved path and file metadata; grouped checks reuse one capture. Mouse clicks record a monotonic timestamp, and worker-scheduled input deadlines are checked immediately before subsequent mouse input so intervening recognition time is included. Recovery positions are stored relative to the client and rebased when the window moves; a client-size change invalidates the saved position. The game must remain visible and unobstructed.
- `src/click/template_confidence.py` - parses and hot-reloads `resource/template_confidence.txt`. Every winning PNG uses its own strict threshold; Link Raid full-image and level-number winners are checked independently. Missing, duplicate, malformed, or out-of-range entries reject recognition instead of falling back to a global threshold. Before automation starts, `_start_worker()` validates that every PNG in the active pack resolves to a threshold.
- `src/packs/language_switcher.py` - `aim/` junction, pack scanning/selection, labels, `active.json`, complete PNG validation, and required-template validation. Complete validation uses Pillow in addition to the standard library.
- `src/packs/image_scaler.py` - derives 720p/1080p/4K packs from each 2560x1440 source using ImageMagick Triangle filtering. Recipe version 2 invalidates older derived output. Skip requires matching source SHA-256, recipe/tool fingerprint, and target SHA-256. Cleanup normally removes only files managed by a valid old manifest; exact paths in the retired-official-template migration list are removed from source and derived packs even when an old manifest is missing, while unrelated untracked files remain untouched.
- `src/packs/file_lock.py` - repository-specific `Global\\` Windows mutex shared by switching, scaling, worker runtime leases, update-lock recovery, and the installer.
- `src/update/update_check.py` - prerelease-aware update checking and frozen-app updating. Reading remains compatible with one unique `MagiaExedra_auto_<tag>.zip` or `MagiaExedra_auto_<tag>_win64.zip`; new releases must use `_win64`. Automatic install requires GitHub SHA-256, cancellable size/hash-checked download, safe bounded extraction, AMD64 PE validation, backups, hash verification, rollback/recovery markers, and startup-health handshake.
- `src/core/log_setup.py` - stdlib-only logging configuration called once at `main.py` import, before `QApplication`. When stderr exists, the console handler defaults to WARNING and `MAGIA_LOG_LEVEL` overrides it; windowed builds skip the missing console safely. Before any business import, the rotating file handler reads the persisted level from root `settings.json` (including the legacy `gui_log_level` key), defaulting to INFO, then the runtime selector updates both this handler and the GUI logging handler. Pillow inherits the selected root level, so PNG-block diagnostics remain visible at DEBUG. Worker `signal.emit` calls remain visible in the GUI as INFO and are mirrored through the `magia.runtime` logger with a GUI-deduplication marker, so INFO/DEBUG files contain the automation flow. Retention defaults to seven days, accepts 1–365, and startup automatically calls `cleanup_old_logs(retention_days)`; it removes only strictly named expired Magia logs and rotations while retaining the active log family. Every physical GUI line includes time, level, and source; runtime `print()` calls have been migrated to `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
- `src/core/log_fold.py` - folds consecutive identical GUI log records into one rendered line with a repeat count. It affects only the bounded GUI view; rotating log files retain every physical record.
- `src/core/app_settings.py` - atomic persistence for automation mode, per-Worker registered parameters, log settings, and Server酱 notification settings in root `settings.json`.
- `src/core/notification.py` - stdlib-only Server酱 sender using the fixed SendKey API and an official channel allowlist. Each notification selects one or two channels; settings normalization truncates stale over-limit lists to their first two entries. Delivery is asynchronous; failures retry three times with increasing delays, identical events deduplicate for ten minutes, and test sends bypass both the master switch and dedupe. Never log, emit, or include the SendKey in errors.
- `src/core/automation_position.py` - validates, records, and resolves client-relative recovery coordinates independently of the game's screen position.
- `src/core/input_activity.py` - Windows `ctypes` keyboard/mouse activity monitor. Keyboard input, real mouse-button activity, or cumulative mouse travel pauses automation until five seconds of inactivity. Automation mouse operations use a guard context so PyAutoGUI movement and clicks do not count as user activity.

## Critical conventions

- **Template-action return values are `2`/`1`, not booleans.** `2` means success/found/clicked; `1` means not found/keep trying/cancelled. `find_win()` is the exception: it returns a geometry tuple or `None`.
- **Template filenames use the `picture` argument, not `name`.** Template discovery collects `<picture>_1.png`, `<picture>_2.png`, and so on until the first missing number. All discovered variants share one screenshot; normal group actions use only the global highest-scoring candidate. Competitive level search is the explicit exception: it may return multiple selected-level positions in score order, but each position still compares all level groups before it can be accepted. `name` is only a log label. Numbering must start at `_1` and remain contiguous.
- Match thresholds come only from `resource/template_confidence.txt`; there is no global confidence fallback. Keys are logical PNG paths, with optional `<LANG>/...` and `<LANG>/<WxH>/...` overrides. Comparisons are strictly `score > configured_threshold`; equality is not a match. The file hot-reloads after save. Crystalis `result` entries are currently set to 0.85 and use the client area's right half.
- Normal template-position clicks require three accepted samples at 0/300/600 ms, and every sample compares the complete template group. Every winning image must pass its own threshold and every center must stay within `max(6px, client_short_side*0.8%)` of the first center; confirmation moves no mouse and the final click uses the median center. Find-only checks, raw coordinate actions, and last-safe-position recovery clicks do not use this positional filter.
- `click_fixed_position_for_item_with_result()` is a separate page-gated action: it requires three accepted presence samples at 0/300/600 ms, may restrict recognition to declared foreground variants, and then clicks the configured scaled coordinate rather than a detected center. When `_click_until()` uses this action, keep its finite click limit, never fall back to the last automation position, and do not accept a next-step template before the first confirmed page click.
- Participant-count detection returns `10`, `9`, `8` (reliably at most 8/10), or `None` (unreadable). Unreadable candidates are always eligible. Link Raid skips 9/10 and 10/10 independently according to `skip_nine_rooms` and `skip_ten_rooms`; both options default to enabled.
- All new PyAutoGUI input paths must wait for `_wait_for_user_idle()`, wrap bot mouse movement in `_automation_input()`, and update the last automation position after success.
- Last automation positions are client-relative records. Window movement rebases them; a client-size change or out-of-client coordinate invalidates them instead of risking a stale recovery click.
- **Run/stop state is per worker.** `_running()` is `_active and not _stop_event.is_set()`. Use `worker.stop()` for every user-initiated or application-close stop so `_manual_stop_event` suppresses the automatic-end notification; do not call `_finish()` from GUI code or reintroduce global `guaji` flags.
- **LP recovery values are drinks + 1.** The GUI displays 0-10 for Link Raid and 0-8 for Crystalis, but passes `shown + 1`. Internal `1` means zero drinks and stop on first depletion.
- GUI parameters are registry-driven and persist per stable `WorkerMeta.name`. There are no module-level parameter globals. `ordered_multi_choice` values are non-empty ordered lists with no duplicates; checked-item order is runtime priority.
- Major Worker events use `majorEvent(event_key, reason, params)` and are routed by `main.py`; they must contain only necessary non-sensitive data. `_emit_major_event()` records that the run already reported a major event, preventing a duplicate `worker_auto_ended` event in `finally`. Server酱 sending must never block worker execution.

## Template packs and `aim`

- `aim/` is a runtime Windows directory junction, not a real template folder. It points to `language/<LANG>/<LANG>_<WxH>/`.
- Source packs are `language/EN/EN_2560x1440` and `language/JP/JP_2560x1440`. Derived 720p/1080p/4K directories are preserved by committed `.gitkeep` files and populated by the automatic startup refresh or `刷新列表`.
- The GUI exposes only the language dropdown. Language selection is persisted immediately on `QComboBox.activated`, even when the game is unavailable; startup restores that preference, reports when the game is not running, and selects the closest usable resolution when it is running. Programmatic refresh does not trigger language switching.
- A pack is usable only when its safe real directory tree contains at least one non-reparse PNG that passes structure, CRC, and Pillow decode checks.
- `language/active.json` stores the preferred language and last compatible resolution. The actual `aim` target remains authoritative for the template currently in use.
- `resource/template_confidence.txt` must contain a valid threshold for every logical PNG. Add the configuration entry together with a new template; never introduce a code-level default threshold.
- Never manually merge/rename `aim/` or edit derived templates as the source of truth. Add variants to the 2K source pack and regenerate.
- Do not delete empty-pack `.gitkeep` placeholders. Missing pack directories are not recreated by the scaler.

## Runtime prerequisites

- The game should use one of the supported nominal 16:9 windowed resolutions and the selected language. Startup compares client width/height independently using `max(40px, expected*10%)`, selects the closest usable pack, and then verifies it; this blocks obvious mismatch but is not pixel-perfect equivalence.
- The game must remain visible and unobstructed. Recognition and battle-motion recovery capture only the visible game client area, excluding title bars and borders. The bot repeatedly restores/activates `MadokaExedra` and uses the global mouse.
- Unknown/mismatched resolution blocks startup. Scaled coordinate actions reject an unknown pack factor rather than guessing 2K.
- `resource/main.ico` and `resource/template_confidence.txt` must remain beside the source/exe root.
- Changing the hardcoded game title requires updating `main.py`, `click_action.py`, and `click_behavior.py`, or centralizing it first.

## Bot modes

Two selectable mode flows have required starting screens. Their code is independent, but only one worker can run in one GUI process; automation, scaling, and update installation are mutually exclusive.

- **Link Raid:** start on the main/Lighthouse screen. Initial clicks use scaled 2K baselines `(2000,1000)` and `(2400,1200)`. Users may enable multiple LV4/LV6-LV12 choices and order their priority; all supported level templates remain required because they compete at every candidate. The first-run default is `[LV6]`. Unreadable participant counts are eligible; 9/10 and 10/10 have separate default-on skip options. Full/already-ended rooms are dismissed and rematched without joining an unselected level. Result continuation uses foreground variants 1/2 to gate at most two bottom-center safe clicks, then returns directly.
- **Crystalis:** start on the team-select screen where clicking `play` starts battle. A scaled `(2000,1000)` wake-up click occurs before template actions.

## Git and local artifacts

- `.gitignore` ignores `aim/`, `language/active.json`, root `settings.json`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, and `logs/`.
- `.gitignore` ignores root `USER_REQUIREMENTS.txt`; it is a machine-local continuity ledger and must never be committed or packaged.
- `.gitignore` also ignores generated derived PNGs, `.source_hashes.json`, `.release-venv-*/`, `build/`, `dist/`, and generated `*.spec` files, while committed `.gitkeep` pack placeholders remain tracked.
- `tools/ImageMagick/` is committed and required by release packages.
- The repository has `main`, `beta`, and potentially other target branches. Never infer target branch or release channel from the current branch alone. Direct push versus PR depends on the user's request and permissions.
- Commit messages are plain-language Chinese with a concise subject and body.

## Push and release workflow

- Before every user-requested push, ask one short confirmation unless already answered: is this only a commit/push with no release, or a Release? For a Release, also confirm exact version, stable/beta channel, and target branch. A no-release push does not require a stable/beta choice.
- A no-release push must not create a tag, artifact, or GitHub Release.
- Release versions use explicit three-part SemVer. `VERSION` has no `v`; the Git tag and Release `tag_name` are exactly `v{VERSION}`, while the GitHub Release display name/title is exactly `{VERSION}` without `v`. Stable has no prerelease suffix and `prerelease=false`; beta uses the confirmed suffix and `prerelease=true`. VERSION, tag/`tag_name`, Release display name, and asset tag fragment must agree after applying their required prefixes.
- Fetch remote branches/tags first and check for an existing same-name tag, Release display name, or asset. Never move a published tag.
- Choose and record an ancestor release baseline. Stable normally uses the previous stable ancestor; beta uses the previous beta ancestor, or nearest stable ancestor if no prior beta exists. Review every commit and the full diff from baseline to release commit.
- Update `src/update/update_check.py::VERSION` and version-specific docs, including the version in the static Release badge URL and alt text in all three README files, then run all applicable non-game checks. Keep that badge on the static `img.shields.io/badge/Release-...` endpoint; do not use the dynamic `github/v/release` endpoint because GitHub Camo may cache a broken upstream response.
- Build into fresh output/staging with `pyinstaller -D --windowed -i resource/main.ico -n Magia_Exedra_auto main.py`; do not reuse old generated `*.spec` files or `dist/` accidentally.
- Assemble by allowlist: new `Magia_Exedra_auto.exe` and `_internal/`, plus version-controlled runtime files under `resource/`, `language/`, and `tools/`. `Magia_Exedra_auto.exe` must be at ZIP root. Exclude `aim/`, `active.json`, `.source_hashes.json`, locally generated derived PNGs, caches, Git/build metadata, and unrelated untracked files.
- New asset names are strict:
  - Stable: `MagiaExedra_auto_v<version>_win64.zip`
  - Beta: `MagiaExedra_auto_v<version-with-prerelease>_win64.zip`
- Verify ZIP CRC/entries, tracked pack placeholders, no runtime/generated files, and AMD64 PE. Run current `extract_update()` against the final ZIP and confirm its root/manifest. Confirm `find_asset()` uniquely identifies expected metadata.
- Smoke-start `Magia_Exedra_auto.exe` from a disposable copy of the final staging tree. Confirm it does not immediately exit and can create the Qt app/load workers. Remove smoke-created `aim/` and `active.json` before final ZIP. If smoke start cannot run, state why in Release notes.
- Push the intended branch first. Create a **draft Release** whose `tag_name` is `v{VERSION}` and whose display name/title is `{VERSION}` without `v`, upload the one final ZIP, wait for `state=uploaded` and GitHub digest, then compare asset name, byte size, and SHA-256 with local values. Prefer re-downloading and rechecking before publication.
- Publish only after all checks pass. The tag/Release must point to the exact pushed commit. Beta must be prerelease and never latest. On failure keep it draft or remove the bad asset/Release; never silently replace content under a published tag.
- Every Release description uses these sections in order:

  ```markdown
  ## 主要更新

  - 面向用户的改动、重要安全修复和行为变化

  ## 构建信息

  - 版本、Git tag 和目标分支
  - Windows 架构、Python 版本和 PyInstaller 版本
  - 资产文件名、字节数和 SHA-256

  ## 测试说明

  - 实际执行的检查及结果
  - （仅 beta）未完成全流程测试的范围与残余限制
  ```

- Release notes must be specific to the confirmed baseline-to-release range and kept concise (match the v2.2.0-beta style: short bullet per change; build info as one line of environment plus SHA-256; testing section as one paragraph). Only beta Releases include incomplete-full-flow-testing notes in the testing section; stable Releases do not carry such notes and list only the checks actually performed.
- After publishing, report branch, full commit hash, tag, stable/prerelease state, Release URL, asset name/size/SHA-256, checks run, residual limitations, and untracked local build artifacts.

## README and translations

- `README.md` is the Chinese source of truth. Edit it first, then mirror content into `README_EN.md` and `README_JP.md`.
- `README_SERVERCHAN.md` is the Chinese Server酱 onboarding guide linked from all three main README files. Use the official term SendKey, state that it corresponds to the requested app-specific AppKey, link official login/subscription/SendKey pages, and make clear that Server酱—not this project or its authors—collects all subscription or recharge fees. Do not hardcode prices that may change.
- Keep the opening centered block pure HTML: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, and `<a>`. Do not use Markdown headings/links inside it.
- Keep this language switcher identical in all three files:

  ```html
  <a href="./README.md">简体中文</a> · <a href="./README_EN.md">English</a> · <a href="./README_JP.md">日本語</a>
  ```

- Do not translate usernames, contributor names, game-mode proper nouns, library names, code identifiers, or exact GUI labels. EN/JP may add a translated gloss after the original GUI text.
- Translate surrounding prose naturally. `README_EN.md` and `README_JP.md` must end with an AI-translation disclaimer pointing to Chinese `README.md`; Chinese README has no translation disclaimer.

## Wiki

- `wiki-draft/` is the local source of truth for the GitHub Wiki. Each `.md` filename (without extension) becomes a wiki page name; Chinese filenames are supported.
- Changes under `wiki-draft/` may be made and kept locally without immediately syncing the GitHub Wiki. When the user requests a code/version push, include any pending wiki-draft changes in the same delivery by syncing them to `https://github.com/LUODIAN-233/Magia_Exedra_auto.wiki.git` (a separate git repo on `master`). Clone it to a temp dir, copy all `wiki-draft/*.md` over, commit, and push.
- Wiki pages must mirror the corresponding `wiki-draft/*.md` exactly; do not edit wiki pages directly on GitHub.
- Preserve any wiki-only control files (e.g. `_Sidebar.md`, `_Footer.md`, `_Header.md`) that are not in `wiki-draft/`; only add or overwrite the page files that exist under `wiki-draft/`.
- The three-language cross-links inside wiki pages use relative links like `./首页`, `./Home_EN`, `./ホーム`; keep them consistent across edits.
